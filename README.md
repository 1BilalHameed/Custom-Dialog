commonlyused widget all most in every applications there are custom dialogs , so i have created this custom dialog library which is having a general dialog pop up view
with several controls for example you can control the colors of all most every view in this dialog like title color , description color , button color , button text color
even the color of the dialog as well.you can also change the  setCancelable feature as well as you can switch between two button or simply one button as per your requirement!
